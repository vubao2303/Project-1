# Project-1 What for Dinner? 
As a person who needs to eat everyday, I would like some help with cooking or deciding what to eat. I want to have many choices of recipes, and when I can't decide on what to eat I will have a chance to pick a random recipe. If I see something I like, I would like to save it so I could recreate that meal for next time. On the day I don't feel like cooking or following recipes, I want to go out to eat, or in this COVID-19 seasons, get some to go from restaurant near me.
